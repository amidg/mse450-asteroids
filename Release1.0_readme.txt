Project timeline and comments:
1. What went right on the project side, team and time management?
    - Project development happend in according to the plan as much as possible.
    - Team management: I have good teammates that contributed to the code development.
    - Time management: project had to be squeezed into the time between Capstone and other courses, thus time was limited.

2. Lessons learned:
    - MCU must be appropriately chosed based on the existing frameworks, support and development needs.
    - tm4c123gh6pm is a very bad choice for the time constrained MCU development
    - TI Cortex-M4F MCUs have zero support in the open-source community
    - EK-TM4C123GXL lacks many important features that could be implemented

3. Project Progress Report:
    3.1 Project proposal for the Release 1.0:
        - 2-axis joystick with button implemented
        - UART communication to computer via separate circuitry
        - Nokia 5110 screen functionaltiy
    
    3.2 Project proposal for Release 2.0:
        - Fully functional firmware
        - Breakout board with PCB design

    3.3 Achieved results:
        - 2-axis joystick using ADC  -> 50% works (single ADC operation)
        - Seamless PC-to-LaunchPad USB2.0-to-UART communication using MCP2221A integrated circuit
        - Nokia 5110 -> only in simulator, hardware screen was shipped broken
        - PCB design -> UART part is completed
    
4. Comments:
    - TI Cortex-M4F microcontroller is far from being a proper learning device due to the lack of documentation.
    - My project includes dual ADC implementation that is not covered ANYWHERE
    - TI software is propriatory only and does not have an open-source implementation compare to many other AVR (Arduino), ARM (STM32) or any other (ESP-IDF) microcontrollers.
    - Keil and its debug functionality makes it incredibly hard to actually understand what is going on with the code.
